# Roadmap

Stuff to do to make flow better.
All contributors are welcome.

## Quick Wins
* wrap input in a `<form>` so enter key works better
* use `Date.now()` for unique ids instead of just numbers
* add aria-labels to delete buttons for accessibility

## New Features
* **edit tasks**: double click to fix typos
* **priorities**: add high/medium/low tags with colors
* **clear done**: button to delete everything in the done column at once
* **animations**: make cards slide smoothly when moving

## UI/UX
* **empty state**: show a cool icon when there are no tasks
* **undo**: toast notification to undo if i accidentally delete something

## Code Stuff
* separate the localstorage saving logic into its own file
